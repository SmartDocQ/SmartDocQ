        <QA q="Why do I see 'indexing'?" a={<p>We create embeddings and cache your content for fast Q/A. Large files or first-time uploads take longer. You can continue once the status shows <em>done</em>.</p>} />
        <QA q="Is there a file size limit?" a={<p>Yes, uploads may be limited by your deployment plan. If uploads fail, try splitting the document or compressing it.</p>} />
